# TSFlow

Welcome to **TSFlow**, a lightweight and intuitive framework for defining and running BDD tests in your projects, inspired by [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) and [jest-cucumber](https://github.com/bencompton/jest-cucumber). TSFlow makes it easy to write, organize, and execute steps in a structured and readable way.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still under heavy development. Beware of breaking changes !

## Features

- ‚úèÔ∏è **Simple syntax:** Implement and reuse steps with a clear and concise syntax.
- üîó **Automatic bindings:** Bind your [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) scenarios to your step definitions with two lines.
- üíâ **Dependency injection:** Easily share context between your binding classes.
